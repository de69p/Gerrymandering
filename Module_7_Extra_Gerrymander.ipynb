    "\n",
    "### **Problem Statement: Gerrymandering**\n",
    "\n",
    "Gerrymandering is the practice of manipulating the boundaries of electoral districts to favor one political party over another. The goal is to group precincts into two districts such that each district has an equal number of precincts and a majority of votes for the specified party. This manipulation aims to maximize the number of districts won by the targeted party.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Variables Definition**\n",
    "- **$n$**: The total number of precincts.\n",
    "- **$m$**: The number of voters per precinct (assumed to be constant).\n",
    "- **$REP\\_VOTES_i$**: The number of Republican votes in precinct $i$.\n",
    "- **$DEM\\_VOTES_i$**: The number of Democratic votes in precinct $i$.\n",
    "- **$Total\\_Votes_i$**: The total number of votes in precinct $i$, where $Total\\_Votes_i = REP\\_VOTES_i + DEM\\_VOTES_i$.\n",
    "- **$D1$**: District 1 (a subset of precincts).\n",
    "- **$D2$**: District 2 (a subset of precincts).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Assumptions**\n",
    "1. The number of precincts, $n$, is always even, ensuring equal division between two districts.\n",
    "2. Each precinct has exactly $m$ voters.\n",
    "3. Voters vote strictly along party lines, either Republican or Democratic.\n",
    "4. A valid solution requires each district ($D1$ and $D2$) to have a majority of Republican votes, i.e., more than $\\frac{m \\times n}{4}$ votes.\n",
    "5. The solution is implemented using a dynamic programming approach to optimize the assignment of precincts to two districts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective**\n",
    "The objective is to determine whether it is possible to assign the precincts to two districts such that:\n",
    "- Each district has exactly $\\frac{n}{2}$ precincts.\n",
    "- Each district has a majority of votes for the Republican party.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is solved using dynamic programming, which allows us to efficiently explore all possible partitions of the precincts."

    "## 2) Dynamic Programming Solution (20 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Solution Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to determine if it's possible to gerrymander the precincts into two districts such that:\n",
    "1. Each district has exactly $ \\frac{n}{2} $ precincts.\n",
    "2. Each district has a majority of votes for the Republican party, i.e., more than $ \\frac{m \\times n}{4} $ Republican votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, a **dynamic programming** approach is used to explore all possible assignments of precincts to two districts while optimizing the distribution of Republican votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dynamic Programming Table Definition**\n",
    "We define a 4-dimensional DP table $ S[j, k, x, y] $ where:\n",
    "- **$ j $**: The number of precincts considered so far.\n",
    "- **$ k $**: The number of precincts assigned to District 1.\n",
    "- **$ x $**: The total number of Republican votes in District 1.\n",
    "- **$ y $**: The total number of Republican votes in District 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entry $ S[j, k, x, y] $ is **True** if it's possible to assign the first $ j $ precincts such that:\n",
    "- Exactly $ k $ precincts are assigned to District 1.\n",
    "- District 1 has exactly $ x $ Republican votes.\n",
    "- District 2 has exactly $ y $ Republican votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Base Case**\n",
    "The base case is:\n",
    "$ S[0, 0, 0, 0] = \\text{True} $\n",
    "\n",
    "This represents the scenario where no precincts have been assigned yet, and both districts have zero votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Recurrence Relation**\n",
    "The recurrence relation is defined as follows:\n",
    "$ S[j, k, x, y] = $\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "S[j-1, k-1, x - REP\\_VOTES_j, y] & \\text{if precinct } j \\text{ is assigned to District 1} \\\\\n",
    "S[j-1, k, x, y - REP\\_VOTES_j] & \\text{if precinct } j \\text{ is assigned to District 2}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- If precinct $ j $ is assigned to District 1:\n",
    "  - $ k $ is increased by 1 (i.e., one more precinct in District 1).\n",
    "  - The Republican votes in District 1 ($ x $) increase by $ REP\\_VOTES_j $.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- If precinct $ j $ is assigned to District 2:\n",
    "  - The Republican votes in District 2 ($ y $) increase by $ REP\\_VOTES_j $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Gerrymandering Solution Check**\n",
    "To determine if gerrymandering is possible, we check:\n",
    "$ \\exists \\; x, y \\; \\text{ such that } S[n, \\frac{n}{2}, x, y] = \\text{True}, \\; \\text{where } x > \\frac{m \\times n}{4} \\text{ and } y > \\frac{m \\times n}{4} $\n",
    "\n",
    "If such values of $ x $ and $ y $ are found, gerrymandering is possible. The solution is then reconstructed to show which precincts belong to each district.\n"
